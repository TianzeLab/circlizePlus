## Installation
It is recommended that you have the latest version of the R environment installed. You need to install devtools and load it into the R environment, and then you can install circlizePlus from Github.

```install.packages("devtools")```

```library(devtools)```

```install_github("TianzeLab/circlizePlus")```

Every time you reboot the R environment, you need to load circlizePlus again.

```library(circlizePlus)```
## Acknowledgements
We are grateful to Dr. Zuguang Gu from DFKZ for their invaluable guidance and support throughout the project.
## Sample code 
[Dr. Gu](https://github.com/jokergoo) has written a book(["Circular Visualization in R"](https://jokergoo.github.io/circlize_book/book/)) explaining how circlize works. To illustrate the similarities and differences between circlize and cirzelizePlus, we've rewritten the code in the book as sample code. Visit [circlizePlusBook](https://tianzelab.github.io/circlizePlusBook/) for details.
